# **BuzzStack Project**

This project consists of a Laravel Backend and a React Frontend, both dockerized and ready to run together.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### **Getting Started**

To get started with the BuzzStack project, follow the steps below:

Clone the Backend Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/joelebukatobi/backend-laravel-api
```

Clone the Frontend Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/joelebukatobi/react-news-app
```

Place the cloned frontend repository in the same directory as the backend repository for example **"_/app_"**.

### **Creating the _docker-compose.yaml file_**

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project **"_/app_"** and create the file **_docker.compose.yaml_** file and paste the following in using your favourite editor

```
version: '3'
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    networks:
      - buzzstack

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    networks:
      - buzzstack

networks:
  buzzstack:


```

### **Project Structure**

Your project directory structure should be looking like this at this point.

```
app/
├── backend/           # Laravel Backend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── ...
├── frontend/          # React Frontend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── ...
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── ...

```

### **Build and Run the Docker Containers**

Run the following command from the root directory **_/app_** to build and run the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose will build the images and create a network for the backend and frontend containers to communicate. The Laravel backend will be exposed on port 8000, and the React frontend will be exposed on port 3000.

### **Access the Applications**

Laravel Backend: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000.
React Frontend: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000.
Start Developing:

You're all set! You can now start developing your Laravel backend and React frontend within their respective repositories. Any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the running containers.
